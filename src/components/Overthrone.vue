                  <p><b>Description</b>: Overthrone is a 2-4 player twin-stick arena fighter. Grab weapons and power-ups that are scattered around the arena to give yourself an edge in this frantic competition for the crown. If you fall in combat, fear not; take revenge as a ghost by destroying the ground underneath your killer and plummeting them to their doom!  In the end, only one can emerge victoriously and claim the crown. Will you triumph? Or will you beâ€¦ OVERTHRONE?!</p>
                <p><b>My role</b>: Gameplay Developer/Designer</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I worked on movement and combat. Specifically, I worked a lot on "Ghost Mode". When a player dies they spawn on the sideo f the map as a ghost and can throw bombs into the map to break up bits of it.</li>
                    <li>Additionally, I created simple shaders (the ghost's aiming line), particle effects (the bow's charge), and some simple 3d models (the ghost's bomb, the arrow)</li>
