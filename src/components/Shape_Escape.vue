                  <p> This is one of first "complete" games I worked on. I worked on this for 2 weeks for a university project. It's a simple platformer with enemies, spikes, moving platforms. This game is quite difficult, in part because I had a hard time figuring out how to implement wall jumpng. This led to some fun playtestign sessions. </p>
