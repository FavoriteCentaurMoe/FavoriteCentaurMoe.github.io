              The theme of this Game Jam was
              <i>"What does home mean to you?"</i>.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>My team and I wanted to make a game about cooking food for a family. The idea was to have cooking themed mini-games with a story section that was affected by the player's performance in the minigames. I worked on a shoot'em up minigame that would be "shooting" ingredients to chop them for cooking. The story section was suppsed to take place in a 3D living room scene.</p>
            <p>In the end we were only able to complete one minigame (the shoot'em up) and the living room store scene, but we didn't have any time to actually form a story. It was an incredibly fun experience and I can't wait for the next Global Game Jam.</p>
